Description: This program uses a command-line argument to specify the input C-like file a latency constraint specified in cycles, and the name of the ouput Verilog file. The program is a high-level synthesizer that will convert a C-like behavioral description into a scheduled high-level state machine implemented in Verilog. The scheduling algorithm used is force directed scheduling.

This will program works with the C code provide. We have attempted to complete all aspects of the program requirements excluding the for loop test cases. Our implementation of the if statement test cases may not work fulling.

Team Contribution Descriptions:
Andrew Camps - Worked on various aspects of the including creating a skeleton outline of the project, parsing of input file, creating graph of nodes, outputting to Verilog file, and writing scheduling algorithm.

Jason Tran - Worked on various aspects of the including creating a skeleton outline of the project, parsing of input file, creating graph of nodes, outputting to Verilog file, and writing writing scheduling algorithm.
